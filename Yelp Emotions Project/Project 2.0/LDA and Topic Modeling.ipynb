In most regards this place was \"just another bar\" - the wood on the counters and tables was nice, seemed probably new, and the decor was probably a bit nicer than average (though still no serious advantage) everything else I experienced was bland at best, when it wasn't all out negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, before we even got in to sit down, we were being advertised to. The space where a lot of comparable establishments would have someone greeting you and helping you find a table was instead filled by a woman who (without so much as a \"Hi\" or \"How are you?\") was thrusting fliers at people for some challenge they were doing that week across the chain where, if you eat a certain number of hot wings under a certain time limit, you get entered in a draw to win a trip to Toronto. Granted, you still paid for the wings, and from the number of people I WITNESSED trying this, just in the half hour or so we were there, I can guarentee they drummed up more than enough food revenue to have covered a much bigger and more exciting prize. Furthermore, it seemed the conversation I was having with the young lady I was there with was being interrupted every 5 minutes (or sometimes less) by a staff member feeling the need to call the attention of the entire establishment to the fact that another patron was entering the challenge (and then again a few minutes later when 3-4 staff members would gather around the table and start counting down the seconds to when the time limit would expire). This was incredibly annoying, and detracted from our talk so much we ended up leaving much earlier than we'd planned and heading over to the Starbucks in the Chapters nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even while we were there I found the prices higher than average, and the bartending to be highly inconsistent (my first drink was mixed incredibly weak, while the second was so strong i was cringing with every sip). We were GOING to order food, but it took less than 10 minutes for us to decide (due to the distractions) that we weren't going to be there long enough to bother, so I can't speak to that aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I can safely say I doubt a second visit would be as annoying, once this whole challenge was done with, but I really didn't see anything that made me terribly excited to come back, either. Perhaps someday I'll check out the downtown location and see if it's any better, but this one certainly didn't live up to the hype I was given.\n",
